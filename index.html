                    Red foxes live in many diverse habitats. They can exist in forests, grasslands, mountains, deserts, and even human environments such as farms and suburban areas. 
                    They make their homes in the ground. They dig burrows, which are called dens, and this is their safe spot to sleep, store food, and have pups.

                <p>
                    When most people think of a fox, they probably picture the red fox. The red fox has dense fur, most of which is a rusty red color. 
                    They also can have white and black in their coloration. Male foxes weigh 10-12 pounds on average, while females weigh 9-10 pounds. 
                    When the kits (i.e. baby foxes) are born, they have grey fur for most of the first month of their lives. 
                    Their new adult-colored coat comes in shortly after.

                    Red foxes mate in the winter and give birth in the spring. The litter size can be from two kits all the way up to 12 kits. Both the 
                    male and female foxes care for the kits until they leave the den in autumn. The average lifespan of the red fox in the wild is 2-4 years.
